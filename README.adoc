### DEPRECATED
## This repository has been deprecated, and replaced with https://github.com/SMARTRACTECHNOLOGY/gateway-os

RPM spec file for an autossh systemd service

== Building

NOTE: This assumes you already copied the `build-rpm.sh` script from https://github.com/SMARTRACTECHNOLOGY/rpmdevtools-docker[rpmdevtools-docker] to a `${PATH}` accessible place.

[source, bash]
----
build-rpm
----

== Installation

This RPM is included in the Lifecycles Base Repository, so assuming that is properly configured, you can just install it with:

[source, bash]
----
sudo dnf install -y autossh-service
----

This file will also be installed as part of a gateway kickstart.
